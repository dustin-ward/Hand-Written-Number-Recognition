# Hand-Written-Number-Recognition
Basic multi-layer perceptron created in python. Uses the included mnist data set to train with a stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

Currently, the network randomly chooses one of the mnist images and tries to guess it. I hope to eventually add an interface to allow to user to draw their own image.
